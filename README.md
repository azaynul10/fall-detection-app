## Fall Detection System

## Description
This repository contains a real-time Fall Detection System that leverages computer vision and pose estimation techniques. The frontend is built with React and deployed on Vercel, while the Flask-based backend is deployed on Railway. It continuously processes frames from a connected camera stream, detects falls, and provides visual alerts when a fall event is identified. I worked on this for straight 3 days due to deadlines.

## Features
- Real-time camera stream capture and processing  
- Pose estimation and fall detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe  
- Visual overlays for detected falls  
- Pause/resume functionality to inspect historical frames  
- Fully responsive React frontend  

## Project Architecture
**Frontend (Vercel)**  
- Developed with React and Axios for communicating with the backend  
- Displays camera feed, overlays annotated frames, and provides controls for pausing/resuming detection  

**Backend (Railway)**  
- Flask application for handling frame data  
- Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for pose estimation and fall detection  
- Exposes REST endpoints for real-time fall detection, pausing functionality, and retrieving previous frames  

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the frontend)  
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) (for the backend)  
- A camera-enabled device (for real-time detection)  

## Installation
1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fall-detection-system.git
   ```
2. **Frontend Setup**  
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
3. **Backend Setup**  
   ```bash
   cd ../api
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Start the Backend**  
   ```bash
   cd api
   source venv/bin/activate
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Start the Frontend**  
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```
3. **Open the Application**  
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser  
   - Allow camera access when prompted  
   - Observe real-time video feed and detection overlays  

## Deployment
- **Frontend on Vercel:**  
  1. Pushed my frontend code to a GitHub repository and deployed directly from VS Studio to vercel.

- **Backend on Railway:**  
  1. Pushed my backend code to a GitHub repository and deployed on Railway due to storage limitations at Vercel but for some reason it's not wokring as expected but it is still under developement.
